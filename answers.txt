1) 60,883,825,480

2) about 20 seconds.

3) Hash rate = 2^24 / 20 seconds

difficulty * 2^32 hashes / hashrate 
60,883,825,480 * 2^32/2^24 = 311725186457600 seconds

which is about 9,884,740 years.


4) hashrate = difficulty * 2^32 hashes / 10 min
2^56 hashes / hashrate = 0.165 seconds

So it would take the bitcoin network 0.165 seconds.
